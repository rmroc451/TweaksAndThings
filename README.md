# RMROC451's Tweaks and Things
Please Read this **ENTIRE** README before continuing.

This is a mod for Railroader which is available on Steam.

This mod requires Railloader by Zamu.

## Usage
1. Download and install Railloader by Zamu from here: https://railroader.stelltis.ch/
    * Verify you have a Mods folder in the root of your railroader directory. If You do NOT have a Mods folder, you didn't complete this step successfully.
2. Download the `RMROC451.TweaksAndThings.x.x.zip` from the Releases Page of this repo.
3. There are 2 ways to install this mod.
    * ONLY DO ONE OF THE BELOW STEPS, NOT BOTH
    1. Open the zip folder, select the entire contents of the folder and drag the contents to the ROOT Railroader directory.
        * this should put a `RMROC451.TweaksAndThings` folder into the Mods folder created in step 1
    2. Drag the zip file onto Railloader.exe and have Railloader install the mod.
        * as with option 1, this will put a `RMROC451.TweaksAndThings` folder into the Mods folder created in step 1
    * If you DO NOT have the `RMROC451.TweaksAndThings` folder in the Mods folder after completing ONE of the above steps, you didn't complete the step successfully.
3. Run the game and enjoy all of the tweaks and things!

## Notes
1. This mod currently supports Railroader version 2024.4.4. This mod may break in future updates. I will do my best to continue to update this mod.
2. It is possible that the developers of Railroader will implement their own fix for this issue. At such time this mod will be deprecated and no longer maintained. 
3. As the saying goes, use mods at your own risk.

## FAQ
### What does this mod do?
**PLEASE READ AS THE WAY THIS MOD FUNCTIONS HAS CHANGED FROM PRIOR VERSIONS**

Basically, this mod has a couple zones of focus. Caboose tweaks and other QOL things.  Some of those QOL things, I added the option for the cabeese to be required & charge you a "crew salary" to utilize, or pay a monetary penalty.

I was disappointed the vanilla cabeese were largely for show, didn't provide any real reason to have them except for role playing.

Enter Tweaks and Things.

        <ul>

            <li><b>D2:</b> Locomotive messages grab the locomotive `Ident.RoadNumber` and check the `CTC Panel Markers` if they exist. If found, they will use the red/green color and embed the locomotive as an image in the message.  If no marker is found, it defaults to blue.</li>
            <li><b>D3:</b> Currently, One person per server should have this per discord webhook, otherwise you will get duplicate messages to the webhook.</li>

                The primary MU engine still acts as the main air reservoir, meaning train braking emits from that engine at this time.
